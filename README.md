[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)<br>

## What It Does: 
This project aims to make use of **Machine Learning** techniques to detect instances of Parkinson's Disease. The project performs the following tasks: <br>


1️⃣ Data Collection <br>
2️⃣ Data Preprocessing <br>
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis <br>
4️⃣ Dataset Balancing & Scaling <br>
5️⃣ Machine Learning Models Training & Evaluation

## Prerequisites:
I would highly recommend that before the hack night, you should have some kind of toolchain and development environment already installed and ready. If you have no idea where to start with this, try a combination like: <br>


1️⃣ `Python`<br>
2️⃣ `scikit-learn` / `sklearn`<br>
3️⃣ `Pandas`<br>
4️⃣ `NumPy`<br>
5️⃣ `Swaborn`<br>
6️⃣ An environment to work in - something like `Jupyter` or `colab`<br>

For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:
The data used in this study were gathered from 188 patients with PD (107 men and 81 women) with ages ranging from 33 to 87 (65.1Â±10.9) at the Department of Neurology in CerrahpaÅŸa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University. The control group consists of 64 healthy individuals (23 men and 41 women) with ages varying between 41 and 82 (61.1Â±8.9). During the data collection process, the microphone is set to 44.1 KHz and following the physicians examination, the sustained phonation of the vowel /a/ was collected from each subject with three repetitions.

> You can collect raw dataset from [here](pd_speech_features.csv).
